                Hi, I'm Harvey, I'm currently a sophomore studying computer science!
                
                <br><br>
                I have experience producing and video editing with Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects.
                I was also part of Google CSSI 2021, utilizing Javascript and the p5.js library in order to manufacture incredible creations.
                <br>
                Java is the language I know the best, but I love learning so I don't mind switching to a language better suited for the problem at hand.
                <br><br>
                I spent my summer of 2022 designing and teaching programming and other STEM curriculum to K-12 students.

                I found this experience incredibly rewarding, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to uplift my community through STEM education.

                <br><br>
                I often find myself seeking problems to solve and working on technical projects, as this is something I really enjoy.

                I am passionate about music, and spend a good portion of my free time producing and experimenting with new sounds to be enjoyed.
                
                <br><br>
                I highly recommend that you reach out to me on LinkedIn if you’d like to <a href="contact.html">contact me.</a>
